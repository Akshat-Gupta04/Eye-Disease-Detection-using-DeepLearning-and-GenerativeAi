# Eye-Disease Detection
 Empowering precise eye disease detection through cutting-edge **Generative AI** and **Deep Learning** on fundus images.
---

## About the Project

The **Eye Disease Detector** is a web-based application that leverages deep learning and generative AI to analyze fundus images and classify common eye diseases. The system processes uploaded images of the retina, provides a diagnosis based on a pre-trained model, and then uses generative AI to offer a detailed explanation of the findings. The project is designed to assist medical professionals and patients by delivering fast and accurate eye disease detection through an intuitive and modern user interface.

### Key Features

- **Fundus Image Analysis:** Utilizes a deep learning model to classify eye conditions from fundus images.
- **Generative AI Explanations:** Provides detailed and easy-to-understand explanations for the diagnosed conditions using state-of-the-art AI.
- **Modern Web Interface:** Built with Flask and Bootstrap, featuring an animated background, glassmorphism design, and dynamic modal popups.
- **User-Friendly Experience:** Allows users to upload images, view previews, and receive results in a clear and concise manner.

## Project Overview

This project is a demonstration of how deep learning and generative AI can be integrated to provide both diagnostic results and informative explanations for eye diseases. The backend is powered by TensorFlow/Keras for image classification, while the front end offers a sleek and responsive user experience. The generative AI component, accessed via LangChain and OpenAI, helps bridge the gap between complex medical data and user-friendly insights.
